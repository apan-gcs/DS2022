Some other useful resources include:<br>
1. [Python Quick Reference (dataschool.io)](https://nbviewer.org/github/justmarkham/python-reference/blob/master/reference.ipynb)
   * Formatted as a Jupyter Notebook; great for finding basic Python and syntax
2. [Python PEP 8 (Clean Code](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/)
3. Google (You can find documentation for every library and function you ever use.)
